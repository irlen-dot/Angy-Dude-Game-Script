# Angry dude Game

Created by the Almaty Guys. It is just a university assigment. But it was pretty fun though
I like to learn new engines even the most scripted ones (I am  not even talking about Lua).

Also, The Professor is super cool. The guy just started let's playing the whole class,
which was super based. And he started to react and destroy the game as a let's player would. That was super fun to watch. I feel like this is the purest emotions that we should register. Also, I'm kind of high right now.

Also, I moved from gitlab to github, so I will fill the account step by step
