LEGEND

( 
	The legend is how the markup will work in the map.
    The map is just a matrix 'arrays in arrays, basically',
    which holds the order of these symbols.
)

@ = Guy
* = BloodStains1
** = BloodStains2
*** = BloodStains3
**** = BloodStains4

N = NextLevel1

Z = NextLevel3
Y = ShelveWithHammer

=======
SOUNDS
=======

( 
	The most headache brought me the part with sounds,
    Because it appeared that the sounds are created in
    an algorithimacal way. I did not have enough time
    to understand the format, however I will want
    Claude to generate some sounds, and I will
    leave a linked of my forked project in
    my next commits
)
